        <p>Last summer I took a trip to Frisco Colorado. This was one of my favorite vacations I've ever been on. The first day we went on a hike up a mountain to a lake. We were so high up, we walked around the lake and were able to play in snow in July when it was 78 degrees outside. The next day we went ziplining on a mountain. After we got all the gear on, we had to hike up a half mile to get to the first line. Each line after that was close together. The view from going across the lines were the best views I have ever seen. This was my favorite part of the trip. The next activiy we did was 2 mile horseback ride up and down a mountain. This was my least favorite thing because when we got to the top of the mountain and stopped to take pictures, it started hailing on us for about 30 minutes as we were going down. When we got to the place it was warm enough for shorts and short sleeves but when we were done with the ride it was under 40 degrees and hailing on us. The las activity was bike riding. We went on a 8 mile bike ride. We were drove up the mountain in a van and had to bike down and back to the bike place. Along the way there were places like villages and rivers to stop and rest at. On the way back we were able to watch some of the Colorado Rockies baseball game from the highway while we were stuck in traffic in Denver. This trip was very fun. </p>

        <p>The second vacation I went on last summer was to Panama City Beach in Florida. This trip was much more relaxing than the trip to the mountains. Each day except for one we walked down to the beach at about 10:30 and were out in the ocean for about 4 hours until we ate lunch. We came up from the beach at around 4:30 to get ready for dinner. We went to a reastaurant on the beach each night to eat. After dinner we went to a mini golf place. One time we were out playing it started pouring on us, so we had to wait a few minutes until it slowed down to go back out and play again. After it rained most people at the course left so we were the only ones there. One day we rented a pontoon and went out on the bay for the whole day. We stopped at a beach and walked to the other side where the ocean was. The waves were at least 6-8 ft there. We drove around and saw some dolphins and even a shark. This was my favorite part of this trip. This pontoon day was much better than a couple years back when we got one and on our way back to the dock a big storm came out of nowhere. The waves got big and you couldn't see 20ft in front of you. The rain felt like needles as we were driving the boat back. I'm happy that there was no storm this time. This trip was less adventurous than the last but was still very fun.
